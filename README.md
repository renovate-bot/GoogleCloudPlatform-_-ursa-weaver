# Usrsa Weaver: Agentic AI Tutoring System

Ursa Weaver is a framework for building highly personalized, graph-based AI tutoring sessions. Unlike linear "next lesson" systems, Ursa Weaver treats technical skills as nodes in a directed graph, allowing a tutor to navigate unlocked paths based on a learner's mastered dependencies.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Graph-Based Roadmaps**: Skills are defined as nodes with explicit dependencies, enabling non-linear learning paths.
- **Unified User State**: Persistent identity, progress, and session context are stored in a single, portable JSON file.
- **Dynamic Pedagogy**: The tutor uses the learner's background, interests, and personas to generate tailored metaphors and explanations.
- **Extensible Verifications**: Integrated support for Multiple Choice, CLI command checks, MCP tool results, and LLM-based rubrics.
- **Agentic Logic**: Designed to run as an autonomous "Skill" for AI agents (e.g., in a development environment or IDE).

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `curricula/`: The "knowledge base" containing JSON-based skill graphs (e.g., Go ADK).
- `users/`: Unified JSON files for individual learners. (Git-ignored to protect privacy).
- `debugging/`: Verification scripts and a comprehensive test suite for graph integrity.
- `.agents/skills/llm_tutor/`: The implementation protocol for the AI tutor.
- `docs/`: Technical deep-dives into the architecture and schemas.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- An AI Agent capable of interpreting the `llm_tutor` skill (e.g., Gemini-powered coding assistant).
- Python 3.10+ (for verification scripts).

### 2. How to Run
Invoke the `llm_tutor` skill within your agent's environment:
1. Provide the path to a curriculum file: `curricula/adk_go_curriculum_poc.json`.
2. Provide your `user_id` (this will load or create your unified state file in `users/`).
3. Follow the tutor's guidance as it identifies unlocked skills and presents choices.

## 📊 Data Model Overview

### Curriculum (Graph)
Defined in `curricula/*.json`. 
- **Skill Nodes**: Contain title, category, description, and dependencies.
- **Verifications**: Define how mastery is proven (e.g., `command_check` to see if a CLI was installed).

### Unified User State
Defined in `users/<user_id>.json`.
- **Profile**: Identity and technical background.
- **Progress**: A persistent list of mastered and fast-tracked skill IDs.
- **Session**: Temporary context including `current_node_id` and today's learning goal.

---

## 🧪 Verification & Reliability

Ensuring the integrity of the curriculum graph is critical for a smooth user experience.

- **Integrity Check**: Verifies that all dependencies point to valid nodes and the graph is fully connected.
  ```bash
  python3 debugging/verify_json.py
  ```
- **Functional Test Suite**: Exercises the unified state logic and dependency resolution.
  ```bash
  python3 debugging/test_suite.py
  ```
